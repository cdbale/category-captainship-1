# Category-Captainship

## Project Description
* general effects of category captainship 
* reference old paper, Collective and Collaborative Implications of Category Captainship
* extend and apply across multiple chains, markets, locations and categories to get better understanding of overall effects 
* Use hierarchical diff in diff model 



## Data 
* Nielsen data, retail scanner data (RMS), from the Kilts Center archive 
* weekly pricing, volume, store merchandising conditions 
* 35,000 grocery, drug, mass-merchandiser, and other stores (grocery for us)
* stores are from approximately 90 retail chains 
* food stores, data represents 53% of all commodity volume (ACV) 
* 2011 to 2013 
* North Dakota, Washington DC, Minnesota, Missouri 
* Not every Nielsen retail cooperator has agreed to share their scanner data with the Kilts Center, but for retailers that do participate, typically all stores within the 48 contiguous states are included 
* 3 major file types, (1) stores, individual store locations  (2) products, UPC info  (3) movement, price and quantity of goods sold at specific stores on a specific week 
* since movement files are so large, there is one file for each product module code (category?) for each year 



## Discovering SuperValu 
* graph method: looking for breaks at reset date 
* table method: comparing proportion of sales at reset date, looking for product drop offs and introductions
